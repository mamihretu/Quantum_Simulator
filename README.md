QuantumSimulator
-----

A very basic implementation of a Quantum Simulator in Python to learn the basic components

Usage
-----


`````
* clone repo 
* Run main.py from quantumSim folder:  python gui.py
* Use gui to build your circuit
  * use scroller to select the gate you need at each timestamp for each qubit
  * run circuit by pressing run circuit

* Result: the circuit will automatically be run 1024 times and the output distrubution will be displayed as bar graphs



`````



TODO
-----

* Add more gate to circuit and make circuit adapt to more that 6 Qubits
* Add a block sphere visualizer
